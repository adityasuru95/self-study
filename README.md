# self-study
A repo where I work on improving my computational and engineering skills and store all the progress. I am going to gamify this journey into a charting the unknown. With a laundry list of things I need to learn to master these skills, I have divided everything into continents with each of the tiny things I need to learn as individual locations on these continents. The goal is to learn one thing everyday, that is, try to conquer a new place everyday, preferably on the same continent. But even if I have to switch continents a few days because of something pressing or urgent on the day, it is okay. Everyday, I will learn something new and move one step closer to "charting the whole world". 

The way I will conquer a location is by doing the work - preferably going through tutorials, websites, books or building something fun.
